# C-sharp-Exquisite-Corpse-Game

In the game Exquisite Corpse, participants draw either a head, body, or feet of a creature. 
The players don’t know how their part of the body connects to the other two, until the drawing is finished and revealed.

For this project, you’ll write a program that mimics the Exquisite Corpse game. 
Using methods, you’ll be able to randomly combine different parts of ASCII characters so they create a new creature.
